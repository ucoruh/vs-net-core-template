## Overview

This project template provide you to easily create release, testing with coverage and share documentation with other parties. Also process everthing with github actions

## Envorienment Setup

Install required application to your PC

### Visual Studio Community Edition Setup

Install all components or update your installation be sure that you have installed  **.Net Core 7.0**  and **XUnit**

### Package Manager Setup

#### Windows Setup

We will install required application with package manager on Windows so use following script to install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) and [scoop](https://scoop.sh/)

```batch
@echo off
@setlocal enableextensions
@cd /d "%~dp0"

echo Checking if Chocolatey is installed...
if exist "%ProgramData%\Chocolatey\bin\choco.exe" (
    echo Chocolatey is already installed.
) else (
    echo Installing Chocolatey...
    powershell -Command "Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))"
)

echo Checking if Scoop is installed...
where scoop >nul 2>&1
if %errorlevel%==0 (
    echo Scoop is already installed.
) else (
    echo Scoop is not installed. Installing Scoop...
    powershell Invoke-Expression (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://get.scoop.sh')
    powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser
)

pause
```

### Pre-Commit Code Formatter Astyle Installation

Before each commit also with batch script we will format our code with astyle we need to install it with package manager as following script you can visit package manager web site for more details [Chocolatey Software | Artistic Style 3.2.1](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/astyle) and https://astyle.sourceforge.net/

```batch
@echo off
@setlocal enableextensions
@cd /d "%~dp0"
echo Installing Astyle...
choco install astyle
```

Astyle tool need configuration there is example configuration named `astyle-options.txt`

```yaml
# https://github.com/brchiu/openairinterface5g/blob/master/ci-scripts/astyle-options.txt
# OAI is using a style that is similar to the Google style
--style=google
# long options can be written without the preceding '--'
# Convert tabs to spaces
convert-tabs
# Indentation is 2 spaces
indent=spaces=2
# Indent 'switch' blocks so that the 'case X:' statements are indented in the switch block. 
indent-switches
# Indent preprocessor blocks at bracket level 0.
indent-preproc-block
# Indent multi-line preprocessor #define statements.
indent-preproc-define
# Indent C++ comments beginning in column one.
indent-col1-comments
# Pad empty lines around header blocks
break-blocks
delete-empty-lines
# Attach a pointer or reference operator (*, &, or ^) to the variable name (right)
align-pointer=name
# The code line length is 200 characters/columns (this is the maximum allowed by astyle)
max-code-length=200
# If the line contains logical conditionals they will be placed first on the new line.
break-after-logical
# Force use of the linux end of line
# lineend=linux
```

After installation and config file generation we can format our code with following script this script look for .cs extension and format related files according to configuration in astyle-options.txt

```batch
@echo off
@setlocal enableextensions
@cd /d "%~dp0"

echo Formatting Code with Astyle...

astyle --options="astyle-options.txt" --recursive *.cs

pause
```

### Doxygen and Graphviz Setup + MkDocs Material Theme

We will use package manager for this but also we can use several tools I prefer to use following script to install all parties, This setup also use for mkdocs material them documentation generation maybe we can use for project website generation

```batch
@echo off
@setlocal enableextensions
@cd /d "%~dp0"

rem force re-install need "--force --force-dependencies -y" parameters

REM Test if Pandoc is installed
where pandoc >nul 2>&1
if %errorlevel%==0 (
    echo Pandoc is already installed.
) else (
    echo Installing Pandoc...
    choco install pandoc -y
)

REM Test if rsvg-convert is installed
where rsvg-convert >nul 2>&1
if %errorlevel%==0 (
    echo rsvg-convert is already installed.
) else (
    echo Installing rsvg-convert...
    choco install rsvg-convert -y
)

REM Test if Python is installed
where python >nul 2>&1
if %errorlevel%==0 (
    echo Python is already installed.
) else (
    echo Installing Python...
    choco install python -y
)


REM Test if Miktex is installed
where miktex >nul 2>&1
if %errorlevel%==0 (
    echo Miktex is already installed.
) else (
    echo Installing Miktex...
    choco install miktex -y
)

REM Test if CuRL is installed
where curl >nul 2>&1
if %errorlevel%==0 (
    echo curl is already installed.
) else (
    echo Installing CuRL...
    choco install curl -y
)

REM Test if MARP-CLI is installed
where marp >nul 2>&1
if %errorlevel%==0 (
    echo MARP-CLI is already installed.
) else (
    echo Installing MARP-CLI...
    choco install marp-cli -y
)

REM Test if Doxygen is installed
where doxygen >nul 2>&1
if %errorlevel%==0 (
    echo MARP-CLI is already installed.
) else (
    echo Installing Doxygen...
    choco install doxygen.install -y
)

REM Test if Doxygen is installed
where dot >nul 2>&1
if %errorlevel%==0 (
    echo Graphviz is already installed.
) else (
    echo Installing Graphviz...
    choco install graphviz -y
)

pip install mkdocs
pip install pymdown-extensions
pip install mkdocs-material
pip install mkdocs-material-extensions
pip install mkdocs-simple-hooks
pip install mkdocs-video
pip install mkdocs-minify-plugin
pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin

pip install mkdocs-git-committers-plugin
pip install mkdocs-exclude

pip install pptx2md
pause
```

After doxygen installation create default doxygen file with -g option

```batch
doxygen -g
```

This will create Doxyfile for us to modify. Use Doxywizard to modify file. Be sure that your output directory should be **./docs** and all warnings should be opened and warnings stop operations.

#### ReportGenerator Setup

We need to install [reportgenerator ](https://reportgenerator.io/)for creation of HTML test reports, we will use choco to install visit package manager web site [Chocolatey Software | ReportGenerator (Portable) - Generates reports for various code coverage tools 5.1.20](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/reportgenerator.portable)

```batch
@echo off
@setlocal enableextensions
@cd /d "%~dp0"
echo Installing Report Generator...
choco install reportgenerator.portable
```

## Repository Setup

#### Github Repositoy Creation

First create a empty project in github and clone it to your PC,

#### Pre-Commit Action Restrictions

Use following pre-commit script and replace it with `.git/hook/precommit`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Installation:
#   Copy this script as pre-commit to .git/hooks folder

OPTIONS="--options=astyle-options.txt"

# Check if .gitignore file exists
if [ ! -f astyle-options.txt ]; then
    echo "[!] astyle-options.txt file not found. Please make sure the astyle-options.txt file is present." >&2
    exit 1
fi

RETURN=0
ASTYLE=$(command -v astyle)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "[!] AStyle is not installed. Unable to check source file format policy." >&2
    exit 1
fi

# Check if .gitignore file exists
if [ ! -f .gitignore ]; then
    echo "[!] .gitignore file not found. Please make sure the .gitignore file is present." >&2
    exit 1
fi

# Check if README.md file exists
if [ ! -f README.md ]; then
    echo "[!] README.md file not found. Please make sure the README.md file is present." >&2
    exit 1
fi

# Check if .gitignore file exists
if [ ! -f Doxyfile ]; then
    echo "[!] Doxyfile file not found. Please make sure the Doxyfile file is present." >&2
    exit 1
fi

FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMRTUXB | grep -E "\.(cs|java|c|cpp|h)$")
for FILE in $FILES; do
    FORMATTED=$( "$ASTYLE" $OPTIONS < "$FILE" 2>&1 )
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "[!] Error formatting $FILE:" >&2
        echo "$FORMATTED" >&2
        RETURN=1
    elif [ -n "$FORMATTED" ]; then
        echo "Formatted $FILE"
        echo "$FORMATTED"
        echo ""
        echo "$FORMATTED" > "$FILE"
        git add "$FILE"
    fi
done

if [ $RETURN -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "" >&2
    echo "Make sure you have run AStyle with the following options:" >&2
    echo $OPTIONS >&2
fi

exit $RETURN


```

This script will check astyle-options.txt file, gitignore file, README.md file and Doxyfile is exist if not it will be terminate your commit operation. Also after `astyle` installation and `astyle-options.txt` generation it will automatically format your source code before each commit. Formatting configuration will be stored in `astyle-options.txt` .

#### Create .gitignore with TOPTAL API via batch script

Use the following script to generate  .gitignore file, you can change gitignore file by changing the configuration after `https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api`

This is the selected configuration

`c,csharp,vs,visualstudio,visualstudiocode,java,maven,c++,cmake,eclipse,netbeans`

```batch
@echo off

set API_URL=https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/c,csharp,vs,visualstudio,visualstudiocode,java,maven,c++,cmake,eclipse,netbeans
set OUTPUT_FILE=.gitignore

REM Set the running folder to the current working folder
cd /d "%~dp0"

REM Download the API results using curl
curl -s -o %OUTPUT_FILE% %API_URL%

echo Downloaded .gitignore file from %API_URL% and saved as %OUTPUT_FILE%

pause
```

#### Create an Empty README.md file

Create and EMPTY `README.md` file and during project fill required parts 

#### Create Default Doxyfile

Use following command to generate default `Doxyfile` if you didn't create or you can use pre-configured configuration and you can edit over this configurations. Be sure that your output directory should be **./docs** and all warnings should be opened and warnings stop operations.

```batch
doxygen -g
```

#### First commit is ready, You can commit and push your work.

You can use gitextension to commit your work, check if you get any error than return steps and check missing parts.

## Project Creation

Project creation will be based on CLI and dotnet you can see examples in the link

[dotnet new](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new)

### Check dotnet version and installation

```batch
dotnet --version
```

### Create Solution with Name

```batch
dotnet new sln -n CalculatorLibrary
```

### Create Project Class Library with Name

```batch
dotnet new classlib -n CalculatorLibrary
```

### Add Project to Solution

```batch
 dotnet sln add CalculatorLibrary
```

### Create XUnit Test for Project

```batch
dotnet new xunit -n CalculatorLibrary.Tests
```

### Add Project to UnitTest Dependecy

```batch
dotnet add CalculatorLibrary.Tests/CalculatorLibrary.Tests.csproj reference CalculatorLibrary/CalculatorLibrary.csproj
```

### Add Consol Application

```batch
dotnet new console -n CalculatorApp
```

### Add Console Application to Solution

```batch
dotnet sln add CalculatorApp
```

### Add Library to Application Dependecy

```batch
dotnet add CalculatorApp/CalculatorApp.csproj reference CalculatorLibrary/CalculatorLibrary.csproj
```

After this step commit and push your work. 

## Project Development

- Rename Class Files 

- Rename Test Files

- Write Your Functions

- Write Your Unit Tests

- Write Your Code Documenation
